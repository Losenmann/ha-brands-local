# Brands local
Python script for Homeassistant that creates a local copy of brand logos

## For what?
The module creates local backup for brand logos. This feature is useful for ensuring greater autonomy and speeding up data loading on the local network.

## How it works
The brand repository is copied and logos are created using the built-in script. Additionally, the necessary packages for the script are installed on the system. After creating a copy, the js files of the Home Assistant interface are modified.
